    Measured irradiance should be in the array's plane and represent snow-free

    Categorizes electrical behavior into a snow-related mode.

    Modes are defined in [1]_:

    * Mode 0: system is covered with enough opaque snow that the system is
      offline due to voltage below the inverter's turn-on voltage.
    * Mode 1: system is online and covered with non-uniform snow, such that
      both operating voltage and current are decreased by the presence of snow.
    * Mode 2: system is online and covered with opaque snow, such that
      operating voltage is decreased by the presence of snow, but transmission
      is consistent with snow-free conditions.
    * Mode 3: system is online and covered with light-transmissive snow, such
      that transmission is decreased but voltage is consistent with all
      system substrings being online.
    * Mode 4: transmisison and voltage are consistent with snow-free
